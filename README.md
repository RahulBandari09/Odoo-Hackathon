**Overview:**
Develop a Skill Swap Platform — a mini application that enables users to list their skills and
request others in return

- List of skills offered
- List of skills wanted
- Availability (e.g., weekends, evenings)
- User can make their profile public or private.
- Users can browse or search others by skill (e.g., “Photoshop” or “Excel”)
- Request & Accept Swaps:
○ Accept or reject swap offers
○ Show current and pending swap requests
- Ratings or feedback after a swap
- The user is also able to delete the swap request if it is not accepted.

**Admin Role**
● Reject inappropriate or spammy skill descriptions.
● Ban users who violate platform policies.
● Monitor pending, accepted, or cancelled swaps.
● Send platform-wide messages (e.g., feature updates, downtime alerts).
● Download reports of user activity, feedback logs, and swap stats.
